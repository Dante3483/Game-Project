  _description: 'Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are often
    caught as wildlife from the natural environment (fresh water or marine), but
    may also be caught from stocked bodies of water such as ponds, canals, park wetlands
    and reservoirs. Fishing techniques include hand-gathering, spearing, netting,
    angling, shooting and trapping, as well as more destructive and often illegal
    techniques such as electrocution, blasting and poisoning. '
